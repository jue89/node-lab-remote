# Lab Remote

You probably cannot take this code and run it without modifications. But it might be a good example how to use the [node-linux-gpib](https://github.com/jue89/node-lab-remote) bindings.

This application is designed to control remotely:
 * Rohde & Schwarz SMR20
 * Rohde & Schwarz SMBV100A
 * MiniCircuits DAT-31R5A-PP+

(Disclaimer: No, I don't own a cash cow. These expensive lab devices aren't my property, unfortunately.)
